A standalone PropHunt gamemode for FiveM.

Custom Sounds code: https://github.com/LondonStudios/PlayCustomSounds
Original Code and Copyright Holder: https://github.com/MoosheTV/PropHuntV, this fork is just to implement some new features as well as bugfixes.

### How to Set-up

1. Download the source code.
2. Open "PropHuntV.sln" via VisualStudio and build - preferably in Debug so you can provide me with logs.
3. Once built - copy/paste the "prophunt" folder in your resources.
4. Add `start prophunt` to your **server.cfg** file

That's all it takes! Very simple, straight-forward, and doesn't require anything else to be installed.
